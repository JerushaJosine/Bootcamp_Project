First we actually need to know how to identify what we need to clean in the data.

1. Formatting

2. Standardization

3. Spelling errors

4. Additional Spaces

5. Dates format

6. Currencies - It is important if we are importing curriencies into the sql, it is kinda unnecessary and it gives a problem in a long run.

7. Duplicated Data - (Data is not duplication is the far most important issue in a spreadsheet).
