In this project I am using the US President dataset.


First we actually need to know how to identify what we need to clean in the data.

1. Formatting- REMOVE DUPLICATES

2. Standardization - EDIT NAMES: UPPER, LOWER OR PROPER FUNCTION

3. Spelling errors -APPLY FILTER AND REMOVE UNNECESSARY DATA 

4. Additional Spaces - TRIM FUNCTION TO TRIM WHITE SPACES

5. Dates format - ISSUE WITH NUMERICAL DATA : CURRENCIES, DATES 

6. Currencies - It is important if we are importing curriencies into the sql, it is kinda unnecessary and it gives a problem in a long run.

7. Duplicated Data - (Data is not duplication is the far most important issue in a spreadsheet).
